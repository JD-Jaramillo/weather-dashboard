## HTML
Added an HTML with the basic structure and containers for the API data to come through as well as for the cities to all be added as a list on the left of the page, including the search buttons with the icons from Fontawesome.com. 

## CSS
Added the appropriate styling for the page to match the criteria requested, including the styling for the butons, input fields and container. 


## JS 
Created the click event to get the input values from the cities searched as well as several fucntions to fetch the open weather API's and get the requeired data back in order to show the weather information and display it on the page for the user.
